        Hi there! My name is yash kashyap and I'm a software developer at Gray
        Swan AI, an AI safety and security company located in Pittsburgh, PA. My
        current software development skills primarily focus around web
        development, but I also enjoy experimenting with app development,
        creative coding, data visualization, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
        and UX.

      <h2>Bridging the gap between design and engineering.</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm a software engineer with a passion for design. I enjoy
        creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
        development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom
        Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together HTML & CSS is pretty fun!
        Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
        advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
        design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
        inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety
        of clients.
